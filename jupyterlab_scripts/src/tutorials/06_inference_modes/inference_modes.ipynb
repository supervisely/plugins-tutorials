    "## Inference modes\n",
    "\n",
    "The most usual approach of using neural networks for computer vision is to capture an image and feed the whole image to the neural network for inference. However, sometimes more complex logic is necessary, depending on the application. Some examples from our experience:\n",
    "* Crop off the boundaries of the image and only run inference on the inner part.\n",
    "* Run over the input image with a sliding window, run inference on each fragment and then aggregate to get the overall result.\n",
    "* In a pipeline setting, run inference only on specially selected regions. A typical example of this is first running a detection model on the whole image to get rough locations of the objects, and then run a segmentation model to find fine-grained contours on the objects *only within the locations found by the detector*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The neural networks available out of the box in Supervisely all support the above *inferfence modes* with no code modifications. Only inference config for a given inference task need to be changed. Moreover, since this advanced logic is independent of the specific neural network being used, we have factored it out as a part of `supervisely_lib` SDK. It is trivial to integrate the available inference modes with your custom models also, as long as you rely on our `SingleImageInferenceBase` base class for inference. See [our guide on how to integrate your custom neural network with the Supervisely platform](https://github.com/supervisely/supervisely/blob/master/help/tutorials/03_custom_neural_net_plugin/custom_nn_plugin.md).\n",

    "In this tutorial we will go over the examples of available inference modes for neural networks in Supervisely.\n",

    "One important thing to keep in mind is that all the inference modes produce labels in the context of the *full original image*. So, for example, if the original image is cropped before passing it to the neural network, the inference results from"
